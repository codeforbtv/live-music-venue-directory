Live Music Venue Directory (Vermont)
====================================

Purpose
-------

The Big Heavy World Live Music Venue Directory is a tool for
Vermont-based and touring artists to orient to the opportunities to
perform in Vermont. It helps artists identify which venues are worth
putting effort into getting booked at and provides the information
needed to communicate with them. Not every music venue is a good match
with every artist or band. For example, the venue might be too big or
small, or have programming interests that don't fit the artist's style
of music, etc.

Features
--------

The Big Heavy World directory is embedding virtual tour images that
allow online viewers to stand "inside" the venue, on the stage, and
see how comfortable a fit the venue is. The venues appear on a map and
the description of the venue should be a wiki entry on the Big Heavy
World wiki site. Vermont bands will be helped to find their way to
perform around the state, widening their audience, and out of state
bands touring through Vermont via this resource will connect with
local artists, opening up opportunities for gig swaps that bring
Vermont's music to other parts of the world. The venue directory
should be searchable by geographic region.

The idea behind this is use php to provide web services, which will be consumed by a front-side javascript/backbone single page
application, two demos of which are in the demos folder (one with and without backbone).
