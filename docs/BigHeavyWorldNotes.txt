Big Heavy World Interactive Map:
Notes:
Search via:
	Venue
	Event
	Band
	Misc. (music shop, music-related business)
Security is an issue, currently the wordpress theme is shared with the phpBB forum, if either goes down, the other one goes down as well
	Data:
		Interactive Map populated by venue, event, band information
		Need interface to input new information
		Pull events from state calendar to partially populate the calendar
		Need 360 degree views of the venues (virtual tour)
Works like existing map system but with more filters
	General Filters:
		location (radius)
		town/city name
		categories
