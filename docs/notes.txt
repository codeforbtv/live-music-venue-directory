We can do this today perhaps, someone create a mysql table start populating it with data and code like this in PHP

http://davidwalsh.name/web-service-php-mysql-xml-json

So this looks like they are creating a main feed which I am not entirely sure we will need, but what we definitely will need is a web service where we can get all the information on one venue, something like this:

http://www.apilocation.com/venue/als_french_fries.html  and it will give us the json for all fields we have for Al's French Fries in the table.
